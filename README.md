Here is a demo of what I've done so far! Below is a list of features:
* Keyboard input (No MIDI yet)
* Output waveform and keyboard input UI
* Polyphony!!!
* Four basic waveforms that can be combined (No UI or effects yet)
  - You can control the frequency and amplitude of each waveform within each voice
  - So for example, you can combine sine waves at different places in the harmonic series to naturally form a sawtooth wave
  - Or you can play chords using just one voice!
